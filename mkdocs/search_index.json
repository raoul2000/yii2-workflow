            "text": "About Workflows\n\n\nAccording to wikipedia :\n\n\n\n\nA workflow consists of a sequence of connected steps. It is a depiction of a sequence of operations, declared as work of a person, a group of persons, an organization of staff, or one or more simple or complex mechanisms. Workflow may be seen as any abstraction of real work, segregated in workshare, work split or other types of ordering. For control purposes, workflow may be a view on real work under a chosen aspect, thus serving as a virtual representation of actual work.\n(\nread more on Wikipedia\n)\n\n\n\n\nWorkflows (also called Petri net) is a vast subject and the aim of this document is not to go deeply in the theoretical fields. As described in the next chapter, the \nSimpleWorkflow\n behavior only implements a simple subset of it.  if you are interested in better understanding theoretical basis on the subject, you'll find some \nreferences\n at the end of this page.\n\n\nUse case : a blog\n\n\nTo demonstrate how the workflow concept can be used in a valuable way, let's consider a real life example : a Blog. In a typical blog, you would find a model for Post with a \nstatus\n attribute that accept 3 values defined as class constants (this is how status were implemented on the \"old\" \nyii 1.x demo blog\n).\n\n\nmodels/Post.php\n\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    const STATUS_DRAFT=1;\n    const STATUS_PUBLISHED=2;\n    const STATUS_ARCHIVED=3;\n\n\n\n\nIt is quite obvious that theses values define possible states of a Post instance. Moreover, a set of rules are used to define how posts will evolve among these 3 statuses : when you first create a post, it is defined as being \ndraft\n, then it can be \npublished\n or \narchived\n. A \npublished\n post can become \ndraft\n (it is then unpublished) or be \narchived\n. At last an \narchived\n post can be \npublished\n or become \ndraft\n.\n\n\nWhat we have just described here are possible transitions between different statuses of the Post, and if we try to give a graphical representation to this description, we'll end up with our first (and very simple) workflow.\n\n\n\n\nOur workflow definition is:\n\n\n\n\n3 statuses : \ndraft\n, \npublished\n, \narchived\n\n\n6 possible transitions\n\n\ninitial status : draft\n\n\n\n\nTo handle this very simple workflow, there is not much to do as the user has complete freedom to set a post status : any status can be reached from any other status and in this case, \nthere is no need\n for a dedicated extension that would handle workflow logic...because there is no workflow logic !\n\n\nUse case\u00b2: a multi-user publishing system\n\n\nLet's imagine something a little bit more complex.\n\n\n\n\nOur basic blog is now becoming a multi-user publishing system, where each user is assigned tasks : some are redactors (reporter), some make corrections and layout work (they know CSS), and there is of course a chief editors who is responsible for publication.\n\n\n\n\nIf we want to be able to handle posts in our new publishing system, we must think of a more elaborated workflow that will fit this new organization. First of all, let's imagine what could be a list of statuses for our posts :\n\n\n\n\ndraft\n : a post is always created as draft. This is the \ninitial status\n of all posts\n\n\ncorrection\n : the post is being corrected and layout improvements may also be added\n\n\nready\n : the post is ready to be published but not yet online\n\n\npublished\n : the post is online, available to readers\n\n\narchived\n : the post is not directly available to readers, but can be accessed through the archive section of the site\n\n\n\n\nThat is not enough, we must also define possible transitions between these statuses. These transitions strongly \ndepend on how the work is going to be organized\n, how users of our publishing system will interact with each other. For this example we will imagine the following rules :\n\n\n\n\nA Post must always be \ncorrected\n before \npublication\n\n\nthe chief editor is responsible for publishing and un-publishing posts\n\n\nthe chief editor is responsible for sending a post to \narchive\n\n\n\n\nThat will be enough for this example but of course we could (and probably should) add more business rules. Now, based on what we have just define, here is a possible workflow four our posts :\n\n\n\n\nThe first version of the \"Post workflow\" was very simple, and as each status could reach any other status, there was no need for the developer to make any tests when a Post changed status. With this new version, that's another story ! Some logic must be implemented in order to prevent \nArchived\n post to become \nDraft\n, or \nPublished\n posts to be sent to \nCorrection\n by a redactor.\n\n\nThat is when \nSimpleWorkflow\n can be useful!\n\n\nWorkflow Definition\n\n\nSo we have a nice workflow, let's see how the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n can help in managing our Post models life-cycle inside this workflow. First we must create a definition for our workflow.\n\n\nThe default workflow definition format supported by \nyii2-workflow\n is a PHP array. Basically, you provide a class that contains the method \ngetDefinition()\n, and this method returns the workflow definition as a PHP array.\n\n\nThe class is named \nPostWorkflow\n which is by convention the name of a workflow associated with the \nPost\n model. It is located in \n@app/models\n, the default location where workflow definitions are stored. Note that these conventions and default settings can of course be overloaded with values provided by the developer at initialization (this will be discussed later).\n\n\nLet's see how our workflow definition looks like :\n\n\n@app/models/PostWorkflow.php\n\n\nnamespace app\\models;\n\nclass PostWorkflow implements \\raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\IWorkflowDefinitionProvider\n{\n    public function getDefinition() {\n        return [\n            'initialStatusId' =\n 'draft',\n            'status' =\n [\n                'draft' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['correction']\n                ],\n                'correction' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['draft','ready']\n                ],\n                'ready' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['draft', 'correction', 'published']\n                ],\n                'published' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['ready', 'archived']\n                ],\n                'archived' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['ready']\n                ]\n            ]\n        ];\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIt's quite straightforward to understand isn't it ?  \n\n\nNote that a more condensed array format is also supported, but for this example we will use this one as it allows more customization.\n\n\nAttaching the behavior\n\n\nTo be able to manage our Post model inside the workflow, we must take care about following points :\n\n\n\n\ncheck that the Post inherits from\n \nyii\\base\\Model\n : the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n can only be attached to Model objects and in fact most of the time it will be attached to \n\\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n Objects.\n\n\nensure that the Post class include an attribute (or a property) that will be used to store the current status of a post. We will use attribute \nstatus\n with type VARCHAR(40) for our example, but it can be any attribute.\n\n\n\n\nAttaching the behavior to our model is a standard Yii2 operation. For more information on Yii2 Behaviors please refer the \nThe Definitive Guide to Yii2.0\n.\n\n\nPost.php in @app/models\n\n\nnamespace app\\models;\n/**\n * @property integer $id\n * @property string $title\n * @property string $body\n * @property string $status column used to store the status of the post\n */\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function behaviors()\n    {\n        return [\n            \\raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\SimpleWorkflowBehavior::className()\n        ];\n    }\n    // ...\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a \nPost\n model with workflow capabilities. Let's see how we can use it.\n\n\nBasic Status Usage\n\n\nAssignment and Initial Status\n\n\nThe first operation you'll probably need to perform is assigning a status to our model. The natural way to do this is by simply assigning a value to the \nstatus\n attribute.\n\n\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nstatus = 'published';\n\n\n\n\nWhen you assign a value to the \nstatus\n attribute, no verification is done against the workflow and the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n is not event invoked in any way. \nThe status validation occurs when the status attribute is saved\n : at this time only, the post object is considered as really sent to a specific status.\n\n\nThe status validation consists in verifying that the model can perform the transition between its actual status and the value assigned to the \nstatus\n attribute.\n\n\nLet's consider the following code :\n\n\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nstatus = 'published';\n$post-\nsave();\n\n\n\n\nWhen we run this code, we get an Exception !\n\n\nWorkflow Exception \u2013 raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\WorkflowException\nNot an initial status : PostWorkflow/published (\"PostWorkflow/draft\" expected)\n\n\n\nCould it be more clear ? Ok, maybe it could but let's see in detail what just happened.\n\n\nThe \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n enters in action when the Post is saved. At this point it tests if the transitions is possible between the current status (managed internally by the behavior) and the final one (assigned to the \nstatus\n attribute). In our case, there was no current status (the object has just been created) and the final status has been set to \npublished\n, so, from the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n point of view, we are dealing with the following transition :\n\n\nnull -\n 'published'\n\n\n\nThis transition is particular as it happens \nonly when a model enters into a workflow\n. If you remember well, the \nPostWorkflow\n definition above contained a key called \ninitialStatusId\n. This key is used to define the status Id that must be used by any model when entering a workflow. This is a built-in constraint : the first status assigned to a model must be the one defined in the \ninitialStatusId\n key.\n\n\nObviously we didn't comply with this rule as we tried to enter into the workflow through the \npublished\n status and that's why we received an exception advising us to use \nPostWorkflow/draft\n instead.\n\n\nLet's follow this wise advice :\n\n\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nstatus = 'draft';\n$post-\nsave();\necho 'the status is : ' . $post-\nstatus;\n\n\n\n\nNow our post is saved correctly and the output is.\n\n\nthe status is : PostWorkflow/draft\n\n\n\n\nHey wait ! what's that ? we set the \nstatus\n attribute to \ndraft\n, saved the post and now the value of our \nstatus\n attribute is \nPostWorkflow/draft\n. All right, don't panic, this is just the way the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n has normalized the status id, from its short form (\ndraft\n)\nto its absolute form (\nPostWorkflow/draft\n). We will describe this later in a chapter dedicated to the \nWorkflowSource\n component. For the moment just remember that these 2 forms of writing a status are equivalent.\n\n\nsendToStatus\n\n\nAnother way of assigning a status to our Post model is by using the method \nsendToStatus()\n defined in the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavrior\n behavior. When you use \nsendToStatus()\n it is not required to save the model for the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavrior\n to enter in action. A call to\n\nsendToStatus()\n will perform following tasks :\n\n\n\n\nretrieve the current status (stored internally by the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n)\n\n\nfind a transition between the current status and the one passed as argument\n\n\nif such a transition exists, ensure that it can be used and that it is valid\n\n\non success, apply the transition and update the \nstatus\n attribute owned by the Post model.\n\n\n\n\nNote that \nsendToStatus()\n actually performs the transition : the model leaves it current status and goes to the new one.\n It is equivalent to \nstatus\n attribute assignment and model being saved.\n\n\nIn the example below, the output is the same as before, without having to invoke \nsave()\n.\n\n\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nsendToStatus('draft');\necho 'the status is : ' . $post-\nstatus;\n\n\n\n\nAnd of course if we try to break the \ninitial status\n rule again, we will also get the same exception as before.\n\n\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nsendToStatus('published');   // exception is thrown here !\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to remember that by definition, a call to \nsendToStatus()\n does not handle persistence of the model, and it is your responsibility to ensure that the model is saved correctly, when needed.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\nThe \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n maintains internally the \nreal\n value of the current model status.\nTo actually change the status of a model you have two options :\n\n\n\n\nassign a value to the \nstatus\n attribute and save (or update) it : the value assigned to the \nstatus\n attribute\nis considered as the end status of the pending transition that will be committed when the \nstatus\n attribute is saved\n\n\ncall  \nsendToStatus('endStatus')\n with the end status as argument : the transition between the \nreal\n status and the one passed as argument is committed immediately.\n\n\n\n\nGetting the Status\n\n\nIf status assignment can be done by assigning a value to the \nstatus\n attribute, getting the status value of a model should not involve accessing this attribute directly but use the method \ngetWorkflowStatus()\n instead. However in certain circumstances, reading the status attribute value is acceptable, but then it is your responsibility to ensure that both values are synchronized.\n\n\ngetWorkflowStatus() vs attribute\n\n\nWhen you call \ngetWorkflowStatus()\n on a model attached to the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n, you will get the instance of the status your model is currently in. The type of the object returned in this case is \n\\raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\Status\n. If your model is not in a workflow, \ngetWorkflowStatus()\n returns NULL.\n\n\n// first save a post in status 'draft'\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nsendToStatus('draft');\n$post-\nsave();\n\n// now read this post and output its status label\n$post2 = Post::findOne($post-\nid);\necho '(1) the status is : ' . $post2-\ngetWorkflowStatus()-\ngetId();\necho '(2) the status is : ' . $post2-\nstatus;\n\n\n\n\nThe output is :\n\n\n(1) the status is : PostWorkflow/draft\n(2) the status is : PostWorkflow/draft\n\n\n\nSeeing at this result, it is not obvious why we should use the \ngetWorkflowStatus()\n method instead of direct attribute access to get the status of a model. Ok but remember that the \nstatus\n attribute may not contain the actual value of the model's status, until this model is\nsaved (or updated).\n\n\nLet's see that on an example. In the code below, 2 functions are modifying and returning a newly created Post object. The problem is they are both accessing the \nstatus\n attribute assuming it contains the actual status value of the post.\n\n\nfunction foo($post) {\n    // do some fancy stuff here ...\n    if( $post-\nstatus == null) {\n        $post-\nstatus = 'draft';\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\nfunction bar($post) {\n    // do even more some fancy stuff here ...\n    if( $post-\nstatus == 'draft'){\n        $post-\nstatus = 'correction';\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\n$post = foo(new Post());\n$post = bar($post);\n$post-\nsave();  // keep the faith\n\n\n\n\nCan you guess what happens when the model is saved ?  Well, that's when the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n enter into action, but that's too late... The value of the \nstatus\n attribute is \ncorrection\n and the \nreal\n status value stored internally by the behavior is NULL. From the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n point of view, this post object is trying to enter into a workflow through the \ncorrection\n status and we already know this is not permitted : bang ! Same exception again !\n\n\nWorkflow Exception \u2013 raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\WorkflowException\nNot an initial status : PostWorkflow/published (\"PostWorkflow/draft\" expected)\n\n\n\nThis small example tries to illustrate the danger of using the status attribute to know the actual status of the object. Very much care should be taken when doing this and remember that \nthe value of the status attribute does not always reflect the actual Status of a model\n.\n\n\nBelow is a safe version of the previous example. All access are done through the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n behavior.\n\n\nfunction foo($post) {\n    // test if $post is currently in a workflow\n    if( ! $post-\nhasWorkflowStatus() ) {\n        $post-\nsendToStatus('draft');\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\nfunction bar($post) {\n    // note that we use the absolute form of the status Id\n    if( $post-\ngetWorkflowStatus()-\ngetId() == 'PostWorkflow/draft'){\n        $post-\nsendToStatus('correction');\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\n$post = foo(new Post());\n$post = bar($post);\n$post-\nsave();\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, if you know what you are doing you can of course use the \nstatus\n attribute directly to perform some operations. In this case remember that when the \nstatus\n value is set by the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n the absolute form of status id is used (e.g workflowId/statusId).\n\n\nWorkflow Tasks\n\n\nBeing able to guarantee that the model status will only use authorized transition is nice, but the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n provides a way to add some logic to workflows. Let's imagine that we want to improve our Publishing System with this new business rule :\n\n\n\n\nWe have noticed that people in charge of correction are not so reactive, which increases the publication delay. They say it's because they never know when a new post is ready to be corrected and so, we decide to improve our Blog by sending an email to all correctors, as soon as a new post is requesting correction.\n\n\n\n\nThis can be achieved very easily by adding a \ntask\n to our workflow, on the transition that goes from the \ndraft\n status to the \ncorrection\n status. In the (incomplete) workflow representation below, this task is symbolized by a little green square attached to the transition.\n\n\n\n\nLet's see how to implement this \nsendMail()\n task and include it in our workflow :\n\n\n@app/models/Post.php\n\n\nuse raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function init()\n    {\n        $this-\non(\n            WorkflowEvent::afterChangeStatus('PostWorkflow/draft', 'PostWorkflow/correction'),\n            [$this, 'sendMail']\n        );\n    }\n\n    public function sendMail($event)\n    {\n        MailingService::sendMailToCorrector(\n            'A Post is ready for correction',\n            'The post [' . $event-\nsender-\nowner-\ntitle . '] is ready to be corrected.'\n        );      \n    }\n\n\n\n\nIf you know a little bit about \nEvents\n in Yii2, you may have recognized what happens on the \ninit()\n method of our Post model : we have attached an event handler to the event returned by the call to \nWorkflowEvent::afterChangeStatus('PostWorkflow/draft', 'PostWorkflow/correction')\n\nwhich is nothing more than a helper method that creates the actual event name for us.\n\n\nIf you're not familiar with the concept of Event in Yii2, you have a look to the \nYii2 definitive Guide\n.\n\n\nThe Event Model\n\n\nThe \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n is built around Yii2 events. Most of the time when something interesting happens in a workflow, an event is fired, and that's your job to decide what to do : catch it and use it or let it go, let it free, \nlet it be\n.\n\n\nThere are workflow events for almost everything :\n\n\n\n\nwhen a model enters in a workflow\n\n\nwhen a model leaves a workflow\n\n\nwhen a model enters in a status\n\n\nwhen a model leaves a status\n\n\n\n\nFor even more control, each event from the above list is split into its \nbefore\n and \nafter\n variation. When working with events, it is important to understand when each one is fired so to choose the appropriate one to perform a task. In the previous example we have declared an \nevent handler\n in charge of sending a mail to the corrector people, when the post changes from status \ndraft\n to \ncorrection\n. That's already something, but it doesn't completely satisfies our requirement which was :\n\n\n\n\n[...] sending an email to all correctors, as soon as a new post is requesting correction.\n\n\n\n\nIf we take a look to our workflow, we can see that there are 2 ways to reach the status \ncorrection\n : one coming from \ndraft\n the other coming from \nready\n... and this last one is not taken into account by the current event handler installed the Post model.\n\n\nWe could of course handle both transitions, but what if tomorrow, a new transition to \ncorrection\n is added ? To be sure to still notify correctors, the proper solution would be to handle the \nenter to status\n event.\n\n\nThe event handler registration now becomes :\n\n\n$this-\non(\n    WorkflowEvent::afterEnterStatus('PostWorkflow/correction'),\n    [$this, 'sendMail']\n);\n\n\n\n\nThe \nAfterEnterStatus\n event is fired each time a models enters into a status, no matter what is its start status. The \nsendMail()\n method will be invoked each time a post model enters into the status \ncorrection\n, \nno matters where it comes from\n.\n\n\nOk, next requirement ! .. yes, we have some business rules to implement in our super great multi-user publishing system ! (I hope you didn't forgot it). One of our rule was :\n\n\n\n\nthe chief editor is responsible for publishing/un-publishing posts\n\n\n\n\nIn our workflow, the only way for a post to reach the \npublished\n status is coming from status \nready\n. The rule above can be turned into something more \"workflow oriented\" like \"\na post can be sent to status 'published' only by a chief editor\n\". Using the appropriate workflow event and\n\nYii2 RBAC\n feature we can easily implement this rule in the Post model.\n\n\nuse raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function init()\n    {\n        $this-\non(\n            WorkflowEvent::beforeEnterStatus('PostWorkflow/published'),\n            function ($event) {\n                $event-\nisValid = \\Yii::$app-\nuser-\ncan('chief.editor');\n            }\n        );\n    }\n    // .....\n\n\n\n\nAssuming we have created the \nchief.editor\n permission, this event handler only checks if it has been assigned to the current user. If that's not the case, the \n$event\n object \nis set as invalid\n and when this happens in a \nbefore\n event, it interrupts immediately the process of transition validation : \nthe model will not be able to reach the end status\n ( here \npublished\n).\n\n\nYes, you understood well (I hope) : invalidating a \nbefore\n event will block the transition. Events like \nbeforeEnterStatus\n, \nbeforeEnterWorkflow\n, \nbeforeLeaveStatus\n etc .. are concerned but if you do the same thing on \nafterChangeStatus\n for example, nothing will happen, that's too late .. sorry.\n\n\nThere's more than that and events in \nSimpleWorkflow\n is a vas subject that is covered in detailed in \nanother chapter\n.\n\n\nWorkflow Driven Model Validation\n\n\nWhen dealing with complex workflows where model validation rules are strongly related to statuses and user interaction is required, attributes validation can quickly become a nightmare to handle\n\n\nAgain, let's see that on an example.\n\n\n\n\nIn our publishing System, a Post has various attributes : \ncategory\n, \ntags\n, \npriority\n, etc... These attributes are not set at the Post creation but at different moment of its life-cycle in the workflow. For instance, we decide that the author must give a category to the Post, the correction team is in charge of adding tags, and at last the chief editor is responsible for setting a priority to the Post.\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of validation rules for the Post model, this new requirement can be defined by 3 statements :\n\n\n\n\nWhen the Post is sent from \ndraft\n to \ncorrection\n status, it must have a \ncategory\n\n\nWhen the Post enter into status \nready\n, it must have \ntags\n\n\nWhen the Post is sent from \nready\n to \npublished\n status, is must have a \npriority\n\n\n\n\nTheses validation could of course be implemented using the event model we saw in the previous chapter : in the appropriate event handler we would test the appropriate attribute. Ok but why reinventing the wheel when Yii2 provides a great \nModel Validation\n feature ? Why not use it ?\n\n\nSimpleWorkflow\n doesn't only provide a behavior, it also came with a custom validator that will help us in verifying that on a specific transition our model attributes are correct. In the example below, we will check the first rule  : in the \ndraft\n to \ncorrection\n transition, the attribute \ncategory\n is required.\n\n\nuse raoul2000\\workflow\\validation\\WorkflowValidator;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function rules()\n    {\n        return [\n            [['status'], WorkflowValidator::className()],\n            ['name','required',\n                'on' =\n 'from {Post3Workflow/draft} to {Post3Workflow/correction}'],            \n        ];\n    }\n\n\n\n\nIn order to enable workflow driven attribute validation, it is required to use the \nraoul2000\\workflow\\validation\\WorkflowValidator\n validator. When you validate the \nstatus\n attribute, the \nWorkflowValidator\n creates a scenario name based on the transition that is about to occur. Remember that the pending transition is the one that goes from the \nactual\n status of the model (maintained internally by the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n) and the \nfuture\n status (assigned to the \nstatus\n attribute). Once the scenario name is created, the \nWorkflowValidator\n applies all validation rules that matches the scenario.\n\n\nIn the following example, our post instance is first sent to status \ndraft\n using the \nsendToStatus()\n method, and then to 'correction' using \nsave()\n which by default initiates the model validation.\n\n\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nsendToStatus('draft'); // = success : the current status is 'draft'\n$post-\nstatus = 'correction';\nif( ! $post-\nsave() ) {     // pending transition is draft -\n correction\n    echo $post-\ngetFirstError('name');\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe output :\n\n\nName cannot be blank.\n\n\n\nBased on scenario names which are meaningful in a workflow context, we can define validation rules for any attribute model, just like you would do with any other scenario.\n\n\nread more\n\n\nWorkflow Scenario\n\n\nIn the previous example we have used the \nrequired\n built-in validator on the \nname\n attribute, only for the scenario \nfrom {Post3Workflow/draft} to {Post3Workflow/correction}\n. This scenario name is created automatically at validation time by the \nWorkflowValidator\n depending on the pending transition. In order to provide maximum flexibility there are several scenario like this one which that are created the same way by the \nWorkflowValidator\n.\n\n\n\n\nfrom {start} to {end}\n\n\nleave status {status}\n\n\nenter status {status}\n\n\nenter status {status}\n\n\nenter workflow {workflow id}\n\n\nleave workflow {workflow id}\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see \nSimpleWorkflow\n allows to validate model attributes at different moment of the model life-cycle within a workflow. You could for instance validate that the attribute \ntags\n is not empty when the post model \nenter status {Post3Workflow/ready}\n, or as soon as the post \nenter workflow {Post3Workflow}\n.\n\n\nThe helper class \nWorkflowScenario\n is here to assist you with scenario names, and if your favorite IDE includes a nice auto-completion feature, writing scenario name may become a real pleasure (more or less).\n\n\nLet's rewrite our validation rules using the \nWorkflowScenario\n helper:\n\n\nuse raoul2000\\workflow\\validation\\WorkflowValidator;\nuse raoul2000\\workflow\\validation\\WorkflowScenario;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function rules()\n    {\n        return [\n            [['status'], WorkflowValidator::className()],\n            [\n                'title',\n                'required',\n                'on' =\n WorkflowScenario::changeStatus('Post3Workflow/correction', 'Post3Workflow/ready')\n            ],\n            [\n                'tags',\n                'required',\n                'on' =\n WorkflowScenario::enterStatus('Post3Workflow/ready')\n            ],\n        ];\n    }\n\n\n\n\nLimitation\n\n\nIn the Yii2 Framework, scenario can be used not only to control attribute validation, but also to \ncontrol massive assignment\n. \nThis feature is not available in yii2-workflow extension\n where scenario are only used to select attribute validation rules.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nThe \nSimpleWorkflow\n behavior, is not dedicated to provide a complete workflow driven model that would replace MVC or any other pattern. It should only be considered as a set of tools that facilitate workflow management for simple applications.\n\n\nIf you want to know more about the subject, and discover what a complete workflow engine looks like, here is a list of interesting links.\n\n\n\n\nAn activity based Workflow Engine for PHP\n\n\nWorkflow Patterns home page\n\n\nGalaxia : an open source workflow engine\n\n\nezComponent : workflow",

In a typical blog, you would find a model for Post with a  status  attribute that accept 3 values defined as class constants (this is how status were implemented on the \"old\"  yii 1.x demo blog ).  models/Post.php  class Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    const STATUS_DRAFT=1;\n    const STATUS_PUBLISHED=2;\n    const STATUS_ARCHIVED=3;  It is quite obvious that theses values define possible states of a Post instance. Moreover, a set of rules are used to define how posts will evolve among these 3 statuses : when you first create a post, it is defined as being  draft , then it can be  published  or  archived . A  published  post can become  draft  (it is then unpublished) or be  archived . At last an  archived  post can be  published  or become  draft .  What we have just described here are possible transitions between different statuses of the Post, and if we try to give a graphical representation to this description, we'll end up with our first (and very simple) workflow.   Our workflow definition is:   3 statuses :  draft ,  published ,  archived  6 possible transitions  initial status : draft   To handle this very simple workflow, there is not much to do as the user has complete freedom to set a post status : any status can be reached from any other status and in this case,  there is no need  for a dedicated extension that would handle workflow logic...because there is no workflow logic !",

            "text": "Let's imagine something a little bit more complex.   Our basic blog is now becoming a multi-user publishing system, where each user is assigned tasks : some are redactors (reporter), some make corrections and layout work (they know CSS), and there is of course a chief editors who is responsible for publication.   If we want to be able to handle posts in our new publishing system, we must think of a more elaborated workflow that will fit this new organization. First of all, let's imagine what could be a list of statuses for our posts :   draft  : a post is always created as draft. This is the  initial status  of all posts  correction  : the post is being corrected and layout improvements may also be added  ready  : the post is ready to be published but not yet online  published  : the post is online, available to readers  archived  : the post is not directly available to readers, but can be accessed through the archive section of the site   That is not enough, we must also define possible transitions between these statuses. These transitions strongly  depend on how the work is going to be organized , how users of our publishing system will interact with each other. For this example we will imagine the following rules :   A Post must always be  corrected  before  publication  the chief editor is responsible for publishing and un-publishing posts  the chief editor is responsible for sending a post to  archive   That will be enough for this example but of course we could (and probably should) add more business rules. Now, based on what we have just define, here is a possible workflow four our posts :   The first version of the \"Post workflow\" was very simple, and as each status could reach any other status, there was no need for the developer to make any tests when a Post changed status. With this new version, that's another story ! Some logic must be implemented in order to prevent  Archived  post to become  Draft , or  Published  posts to be sent to  Correction  by a redactor.  That is when  SimpleWorkflow  can be useful!",

First we must create a definition for our workflow.  The default workflow definition format supported by  yii2-workflow  is a PHP array. Basically, you provide a class that contains the method  getDefinition() , and this method returns the workflow definition as a PHP array.  The class is named  PostWorkflow  which is by convention the name of a workflow associated with the  Post  model. It is located in  @app/models , the default location where workflow definitions are stored. Note that these conventions and default settings can of course be overloaded with values provided by the developer at initialization (this will be discussed later).  Let's see how our workflow definition looks like :  @app/models/PostWorkflow.php  namespace app\\models;\n\nclass PostWorkflow implements \\raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\IWorkflowDefinitionProvider\n{\n    public function getDefinition() {\n        return [\n            'initialStatusId' =  'draft',\n            'status' =  [\n                'draft' =  [\n                    'transition' =  ['correction']\n                ],\n                'correction' =  [\n                    'transition' =  ['draft','ready']\n                ],\n                'ready' =  [\n                    'transition' =  ['draft', 'correction', 'published']\n                ],\n                'published' =  [\n                    'transition' =  ['ready', 'archived']\n                ],\n                'archived' =  [\n                    'transition' =  ['ready']\n                ]\n            ]\n        ];\n    }\n}  It's quite straightforward to understand isn't it ?

The natural way to do this is by simply assigning a value to the  status  attribute.  $post = new Post();\n$post- status = 'published';  When you assign a value to the  status  attribute, no verification is done against the workflow and the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  is not event invoked in any way.  The status validation occurs when the status attribute is saved  : at this time only, the post object is considered as really sent to a specific status.  The status validation consists in verifying that the model can perform the transition between its actual status and the value assigned to the  status  attribute.  Let's consider the following code :  $post = new Post();\n$post- status = 'published';\n$post- save();  When we run this code, we get an Exception !  Workflow Exception \u2013 raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\WorkflowException\nNot an initial status : PostWorkflow/published (\"PostWorkflow/draft\" expected)  Could it be more clear ? Ok, maybe it could but let's see in detail what just happened.  The  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  enters in action when the Post is saved. At this point it tests if the transitions is possible between the current status (managed internally by the behavior) and the final one (assigned to the  status  attribute). In our case, there was no current status (the object has just been created) and the final status has been set to  published , so, from the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  point of view, we are dealing with the following transition :  null -  'published'  This transition is particular as it happens  only when a model enters into a workflow . If you remember well, the  PostWorkflow  definition above contained a key called  initialStatusId . This key is used to define the status Id that must be used by any model when entering a workflow. This is a built-in constraint : the first status assigned to a model must be the one defined in the  initialStatusId  key.  Obviously we didn't comply with this rule as we tried to enter into the workflow through the  published  status and that's why we received an exception advising us to use  PostWorkflow/draft  instead.  Let's follow this wise advice :  $post = new Post();\n$post- status = 'draft';\n$post- save();\necho 'the status is : ' . $post- status;  Now our post is saved correctly and the output is.  the status is : PostWorkflow/draft  Hey wait ! what's that ? we set the  status  attribute to  draft , saved the post and now the value of our  status  attribute is  PostWorkflow/draft . All right, don't panic, this is just the way the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  has normalized the status id, from its short form ( draft )\nto its absolute form ( PostWorkflow/draft ). We will describe this later in a chapter dedicated to the  WorkflowSource  component. For the moment just remember that these 2 forms of writing a status are equivalent.",

A call to sendToStatus()  will perform following tasks :   retrieve the current status (stored internally by the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior )  find a transition between the current status and the one passed as argument  if such a transition exists, ensure that it can be used and that it is valid  on success, apply the transition and update the  status  attribute owned by the Post model.   Note that  sendToStatus()  actually performs the transition : the model leaves it current status and goes to the new one.  It is equivalent to  status  attribute assignment and model being saved.  In the example below, the output is the same as before, without having to invoke  save() .  $post = new Post();\n$post- sendToStatus('draft');\necho 'the status is : ' . $post- status;  And of course if we try to break the  initial status  rule again, we will also get the same exception as before.  $post = new Post();\n$post- sendToStatus('published');   // exception is thrown here !

Ok but remember that the  status  attribute may not contain the actual value of the model's status, until this model is\nsaved (or updated).  Let's see that on an example. In the code below, 2 functions are modifying and returning a newly created Post object. The problem is they are both accessing the  status  attribute assuming it contains the actual status value of the post.  function foo($post) {\n    // do some fancy stuff here ...\n    if( $post- status == null) {\n        $post- status = 'draft';\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\nfunction bar($post) {\n    // do even more some fancy stuff here ...\n    if( $post- status == 'draft'){\n        $post- status = 'correction';\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\n$post = foo(new Post());\n$post = bar($post);\n$post- save();  // keep the faith  Can you guess what happens when the model is saved ?  Well, that's when the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  enter into action, but that's too late... The value of the  status  attribute is  correction  and the  real  status value stored internally by the behavior is NULL.

Same exception again !  Workflow Exception \u2013 raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\WorkflowException\nNot an initial status : PostWorkflow/published (\"PostWorkflow/draft\" expected)  This small example tries to illustrate the danger of using the status attribute to know the actual status of the object. Very much care should be taken when doing this and remember that  the value of the status attribute does not always reflect the actual Status of a model .  Below is a safe version of the previous example. All access are done through the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  behavior.  function foo($post) {\n    // test if $post is currently in a workflow\n    if( ! $post- hasWorkflowStatus() ) {\n        $post- sendToStatus('draft');\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\nfunction bar($post) {\n    // note that we use the absolute form of the status Id\n    if( $post- getWorkflowStatus()- getId() == 'PostWorkflow/draft'){\n        $post- sendToStatus('correction');\n    }\n    return $post;\n}\n\n$post = foo(new Post());\n$post = bar($post);\n$post- save();  That being said, if you know what you are doing you can of course use the  status  attribute directly to perform some operations.

'] is ready to be corrected.'\n        );      \n    }  If you know a little bit about  Events  in Yii2, you may have recognized what happens on the  init()  method of our Post model : we have attached an event handler to the event returned by the call to  WorkflowEvent::afterChangeStatus('PostWorkflow/draft', 'PostWorkflow/correction') \nwhich is nothing more than a helper method that creates the actual event name for us.  If you're not familiar with the concept of Event in Yii2, you have a look to the  Yii2 definitive Guide .",

            "text": "The  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  is built around Yii2 events. Most of the time when something interesting happens in a workflow, an event is fired, and that's your job to decide what to do : catch it and use it or let it go, let it free,  let it be .  There are workflow events for almost everything :   when a model enters in a workflow  when a model leaves a workflow  when a model enters in a status  when a model leaves a status   For even more control, each event from the above list is split into its  before  and  after  variation. When working with events, it is important to understand when each one is fired so to choose the appropriate one to perform a task. In the previous example we have declared an  event handler  in charge of sending a mail to the corrector people, when the post changes from status  draft  to  correction . That's already something, but it doesn't completely satisfies our requirement which was :   [...] sending an email to all correctors, as soon as a new post is requesting correction.   If we take a look to our workflow, we can see that there are 2 ways to reach the status  correction  : one coming from  draft  the other coming from  ready ... and this last one is not taken into account by the current event handler installed the Post model.  We could of course handle both transitions, but what if tomorrow, a new transition to  correction  is added ? To be sure to still notify correctors, the proper solution would be to handle the  enter to status  event.  The event handler registration now becomes :  $this- on(\n    WorkflowEvent::afterEnterStatus('PostWorkflow/correction'),\n    [$this, 'sendMail']\n);  The  AfterEnterStatus  event is fired each time a models enters into a status, no matter what is its start status. The  sendMail()  method will be invoked each time a post model enters into the status  correction ,  no matters where it comes from .  Ok, next requirement ! .. yes, we have some business rules to implement in our super great multi-user publishing system ! (I hope you didn't forgot it). One of our rule was :   the chief editor is responsible for publishing/un-publishing posts   In our workflow, the only way for a post to reach the  published  status is coming from status  ready . The rule above can be turned into something more \"workflow oriented\" like \" a post can be sent to status 'published' only by a chief editor \". Using the appropriate workflow event and Yii2 RBAC  feature we can easily implement this rule in the Post model.  use raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function init()\n    {\n        $this- on(\n            WorkflowEvent::beforeEnterStatus('PostWorkflow/published'),\n            function ($event) {\n                $event- isValid = \\Yii::$app- user- can('chief.editor');\n            }\n        );\n    }\n    // .....  Assuming we have created the  chief.editor  permission, this event handler only checks if it has been assigned to the current user. If that's not the case, the  $event  object  is set as invalid  and when this happens in a  before  event, it interrupts immediately the process of transition validation :  the model will not be able to reach the end status  ( here  published ).  Yes, you understood well (I hope) : invalidating a  before  event will block the transition. Events like  beforeEnterStatus ,  beforeEnterWorkflow ,  beforeLeaveStatus  etc .. are concerned but if you do the same thing on  afterChangeStatus  for example, nothing will happen, that's too late .. sorry.  There's more than that and events in  SimpleWorkflow  is a vas subject that is covered in detailed in  another chapter .",

            "text": "When dealing with complex workflows where model validation rules are strongly related to statuses and user interaction is required, attributes validation can quickly become a nightmare to handle  Again, let's see that on an example.   In our publishing System, a Post has various attributes :  category ,  tags ,  priority , etc... These attributes are not set at the Post creation but at different moment of its life-cycle in the workflow. For instance, we decide that the author must give a category to the Post, the correction team is in charge of adding tags, and at last the chief editor is responsible for setting a priority to the Post.   In terms of validation rules for the Post model, this new requirement can be defined by 3 statements :   When the Post is sent from  draft  to  correction  status, it must have a  category  When the Post enter into status  ready , it must have  tags  When the Post is sent from  ready  to  published  status, is must have a  priority   Theses validation could of course be implemented using the event model we saw in the previous chapter : in the appropriate event handler we would test the appropriate attribute. Ok but why reinventing the wheel when Yii2 provides a great  Model Validation  feature ? Why not use it ?  SimpleWorkflow  doesn't only provide a behavior, it also came with a custom validator that will help us in verifying that on a specific transition our model attributes are correct. In the example below, we will check the first rule  : in the  draft  to  correction  transition, the attribute  category  is required.  use raoul2000\\workflow\\validation\\WorkflowValidator;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function rules()\n    {\n        return [\n            [['status'], WorkflowValidator::className()],\n            ['name','required',\n                'on' =  'from {Post3Workflow/draft} to {Post3Workflow/correction}'],            \n        ];\n    }  In order to enable workflow driven attribute validation, it is required to use the  raoul2000\\workflow\\validation\\WorkflowValidator  validator. When you validate the  status  attribute, the  WorkflowValidator  creates a scenario name based on the transition that is about to occur. Remember that the pending transition is the one that goes from the  actual  status of the model (maintained internally by the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior ) and the  future  status (assigned to the  status  attribute). Once the scenario name is created, the  WorkflowValidator  applies all validation rules that matches the scenario.  In the following example, our post instance is first sent to status  draft  using the  sendToStatus()  method, and then to 'correction' using  save()  which by default initiates the model validation.  $post = new Post();\n$post- sendToStatus('draft'); // = success : the current status is 'draft'\n$post- status = 'correction';\nif( ! $post- save() ) {     // pending transition is draft -  correction\n    echo $post- getFirstError('name');\n}  The output :  Name cannot be blank.  Based on scenario names which are meaningful in a workflow context, we can define validation rules for any attribute model, just like you would do with any other scenario.  read more",

In order to provide maximum flexibility there are several scenario like this one which that are created the same way by the  WorkflowValidator .   from {start} to {end}  leave status {status}  enter status {status}  enter status {status}  enter workflow {workflow id}  leave workflow {workflow id}   As you can see  SimpleWorkflow  allows to validate model attributes at different moment of the model life-cycle within a workflow.

To do so, simply create a class that implements the \nraoul2000\\workflow\\events\\IEventSequence\n interface (see below).\n\n\nConfiguration\n\n\nWhen the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n is initialized, it tries to get a reference to the \nEvent Sequence Component\n to use. By default this component is assumed to have the id \neventSequence\n. If no such component is available, \nit will create one\n using the \nBasicEventSequence\n class and register it in the Yii2 application so to make it available to other \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n.\n\n\nTo summarize :\n\n\n\n\neventSequence\n : default Id of the event sequence component used by the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n\n\nBasicEventSequence\n : default event sequence type\n\n\n\n\nIf for instance you want to use the \nReducedEventSequence\n instead of the default one, you must configure it like you would do for any other Yii2 component.\n\n\n$config = [\n    // ....\n    'components' =\n [\n        // the default event sequence component is configured as a ReducedEventSequence\n        // and not a BasicEventSequence anymore\n        'eventSequence' =\n [\n          'class' =\n '\\raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\ReducedEventSequence',\n        ]\n   // ...\n\n\n\n\nThe \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n will then use the configured \neventSequence\n component.\n\n\nYou may also want to use a reduced event sequence for one particular workflow, and the basic event sequence with another ones.\nThis can be easily achieved by configuring the ID of the event sequence component that a \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n should use.\n\n\nIn the example below we are first configuring a new component with the ID \nmyReducedEventSequence\n and with type \nReducedEventSequence\n.\n\n\n$config = [\n    // ....\n    'components' =\n [\n        'myReducedEventSequence' =\n [\n          'class' =\n '\\raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\ReducedEventSequence',\n        ]\n   // ...\n\n\n\n\nNow let's tell to the behavior of the Post model that it must use the \nmyReducedEventSequence\n event sequence component configured above\ninstead of the default one.\n\n\nnamespace app\\models;\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function behaviors()\n    {\n        return [\n            [\n                'class' =\n \\raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\SimpleWorkflowBehavior::className(),\n                'eventSequence' =\n 'myReducedEventSequence'\n            ]\n        ];\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAny other model with a \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n will keep using the default Event sequence (\nBasicEventSequence\n) but the Post model will use a specific one (\nReducedEventSequence\n).\n\n\nSimpleWorkflow\n events are enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the \neventSequence\n configuration parameter to NULL when attaching the behavior to the model.

If the WorkflowEvent is fired because the model \nenters\n into a workflow, this method returns \nnull\n.\n\n\ngetEndStatus()\n : returns the Status instance that the model is reaching. If the WorkflowEvent is fired because the model \nleaves\n a workflow, this method returns \nnull\n.\n\n\ngetTransition()\n : returns the Transition instance that the model is performing. Note that if the WorkflowEvent is fired because the model \nenters\n or \nleaves\n the workflow, this method returns \nnull\n.\n\n\n\n\nRemember that a \nWorkflowEvent\n object is passed to all attached handlers(see next chapter).\n\n\nEvent Handler\n\n\nA event handler is used to implement a specific process on any of the events in the event sequence. Installing an event handler is a standard operation described in the \nYii2 Definitive Guide\n.\n\n\nIn the example below, we are attaching an handler for the event that is fired when a Post instance goes from the status \ndraft\n to the status \ncorrection\n. When this happens, we have decided to send a mail.\n\n\nuse raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function init()\n    {\n        $this-\non(\n            'afterChangeStatusFrom{PostWorkflow/draft}to{PostWorkflow/correction}',\n            [$this, 'sendMail']\n        );\n    }\n    // $event is an instance of raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent\n    public function sendMail($event)\n    {\n        MailingService::sendMailToCorrector(\n            'A Post is ready for correction',\n            'The post [' . $event-\nsender-\nowner-\ntitle . '] is ready to be corrected.'\n        );      \n    }\n\n\n\n\nbefore vs after\n\n\nEach event fired by the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n can be of 2 types : \nbefore\n or \nafter\n. The difference between these types is that a handler attached to a \nbefore\n event is able to block the transition in progress by \ninvalidating\n the event. This is not possible for a handler attached to a \"after* event. Using this feature it becomes possible to block a transition based on the result of a complex processing.\n\n\nIn the following example, an event handler is attached to be invoked \nbefore\n a Post instance enters into the status 'Post/published'. This handler checks that the user who is performing the action has the appropriate permission and if not it \ninvalidates\n the event : the Post instance will not be able to reach the status 'W1/A', the transition is blocked.\n\n\nuse raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent;\n\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function init()\n    {\n        $this-\non(\n            'beforeEnterStatus{Post/published}',\n            function ($event) {\n                // if the user doesn't have the current authorization, the transition to 'Post/published' is blocked\n\n                if( \\Yii::$app-\nuser-\ncan('publish.post') == false) {\n                    $event-\ninvalidate(\nyou don't have permission to publish this post\n);\n                }\n            }\n        );\n    }\n    // .....\n\n\n\n\nEvent handlers attached to \nbefore\n events allow you to authorize or forbid a transition based on the result of a custom code execution.\n\n\nStatus Constraint\n\n\nIf you have been using the previous version of \nSimpleWorkflow\n (only compatible with Yii 1.x) you may be familiar with \nStatus Constraint\n.\nA \nStatus Constraint\n is a piece of PHP code associated with a status and evaluated as a logical expression \nbefore a model enters into this status\n : if the evaluation succeeds, the model can enter the status otherwise the transition is blocked and the model remains in its current status (\nread more\n).\n\n\nStatus Constraint\n are \nnot declared anymore as PHP code inside the workflow definition\n like in version 1.x but as event handlers attached to the \nbefore\n event type, just like in the previous example where in fact, we have defined a constraint on the status \nW1/A\n.\n\n\nRemember that an event handler attached to a \nbefore\n event type is able to block the transition by invalidating the event object, and that's exactly what a \nStatus Constraint\n does !\n\n\nWorkflow Tasks\n\n\nJust like \nStatus Constraint\n above, \nWorkflow Task\n is a feature available with the previous version of \nSimpleWorkflow\n.\nTo summarize, a workflow task is a piece of PHP code attached to a transition and executed when the transition is performed by the model ( \nread more\n).\n\n\nSuch feature must now be implemented as an event handler attached to an \nafter\n event and not anymore as PHP code defined in the workflow definition (like it used to be in version 1.x). In a \nprevious chapter\n we have already created a workflow task by\nattaching a handler to the event \nafterChangeStatusFrom{PostWorkflow/draft}to{PostWorkflow/correction}\n : a mail is sent when the model goes from \ndraft\n to \ncorrection\n.\n\n\nGetting The Event Sequence\n\n\nOnce \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n is attached to model, it injects several method that you can use directly from a model instance (this is \nstandard Yii2 feature\n). Among these methods, \ngetEventSequence()\n is particularly useful when working with events. This method returns an array describing all the events that will be fired if the model is sent to the status passed as argument. This array has 2 keys : \nbefore\n and \nafter\n. The value of each key is an array of \nraoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent\n objects representing the event that will be fired before and after the transition.\n\n\nLet's see that on the example below where we assume that the \n$post\n instance in currently in status \nready\n. This snippet is displaying the ordered list of event that will be fired when \n$post\n is sent to status \npublished\n.\n\n\n// $post is assumed to be in status 'ready'\nforeach ($post-\ngetEventSequence('published') as $type =\n $events) {\n    foreach($events as $event) {\n        echo 'type = '.$type. ' event name = '.$event-\nname.'\nbr/\n';\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe transition we are working on is from \nready\n to \npublished\n. The event sequence used is the default one and here is the output which matches the \nBasicEventSequence\n specifications.\n\n\ntype = before event name = beforeLeaveStatus{PostWorkflow/ready}\ntype = before event name = beforeChangeStatusFrom{PostWorkflow/ready}to{PostWorkflow/published}\ntype = before event name = beforeEnterStatus{PostWorkflow/published}\ntype = after event name = afterLeaveStatus{PostWorkflow/ready}\ntype = after event name = afterChangeStatusFrom{PostWorkflow/ready}to{PostWorkflow/published}\ntype = after event name = afterEnterStatus{PostWorkflow/published}\n\n\n\nRemember that events will be fired in this exact order until the last event or until the event is invalidated by a handler attached to the \nbefore\n events.\n\n\nEvent Name Helper\n\n\nThe class \n\\raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\WorkflowEvent\n includes a set of static method that you can use to easely create workflow event names.\nIt's even more useful if your favorite IDE supports auto-completion ! The example below is equivalent to the previous one except that the event name is created at runtime by a call to \nWorkflowEvent::beforeEnterStatus('W1/A')\n.\n\n\n$this-\non(\n    // use the event helper to generate the event name\n    WorkflowEvent::beforeEnterStatus('W1/A'),\n    function ($event) {\n        // ...\n    }\n);\n\n\n\n\nCreating An Event Sequence\n\n\nWe already know that \nSimpleWorkflow\n includes 3 event sequences, from the most simple to the most \nverbose\n one (the default is the \nBasicEventSequence\n). However, you may want to create your own event sequence if for instance you want to optimize the amount of events\nfired and actually handled by your implementation.\n\n\nTo define your own event sequence you must create a class that implements the \n\\raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\IEventSequence\n interface. There are three methods declared in this interface, each one being invoked at runtime, when a specific event occurs in the workflow :\n\n\n\n\ncreateEnterWorkflowSequence\n : invoked when a model enters into a workflow\n\n\ncreateLeaveWorkflowSequence\n : invoked when a model leaves a workflow\n\n\ncreateChangeStatusSequence\n : invoked when a model changes status\n\n\n\n\nEach method must return an array representing the corresponding sequence of events, grouped in 2 possibles types : \nbefore\n and \nafter\n events. These types are used as keys in the returned array, and values is an array of \nWorkflowEvent\n objects representing\nthe sequence of events.\n\n\nFor example :\n\n\npublic function createEnterWorkflowSequence($initalStatus, $sender)\n{\n    return [\n        'before' =\n [\n            new WorkflowEvent(WorkflowEvent::beforeEnterWorkflow($initalStatus-\ngetWorkflowId()),\n                ['end' =\n $initalStatus,'sender'=\n $sender]\n            ),\n            new WorkflowEvent(WorkflowEvent::beforeEnterStatus($initalStatus-\ngetId()),\n                ['end' =\n $initalStatus,'sender'=\n $sender]\n            )\n        ],\n        'after' =\n [\n            new WorkflowEvent(WorkflowEvent::afterEnterWorkflow($initalStatus-\ngetWorkflowId()),\n                ['end' =\n $initalStatus,'sender' =\n $sender]\n            ),\n            new WorkflowEvent(WorkflowEvent::afterEnterStatus($initalStatus-\ngetId()),\n                ['end' =\n $initalStatus,'sender' =\n $sender]\n            )\n        ]\n    ];\n}\n\n\n\n\nGeneric Events\n\n\nWe have seen in the previous chapters that using an \nEvent Sequence\n you can easely implement a custom behavior for your model evolving into a workflow, by installing\nthe appropriate event handlers: an \nEvent Sequence\n allows you to react to the exact event you need with a thin control. However, if you don't need such precision, you can\nalso use so called \ngeneric events\n.\n\n\nTwo \nGeneric Events\n are always fired by the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n as soon as a model changes status, and this, no matter what \nEvent Sequence\n is configured. In fact\neven if you choose to not use \nEvent Sequence\n, the \nGeneric Events\n are fired, because they are fired by the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n itself, and not by another component (like\nthe event sequence component).\n\n\nThe names of the 2 \nGeneric Events\n are :\n\n\n\n\nEVENT_BEFORE_CHANGE_STATUS : fired each time \nbefore\n a model changes status\n\n\nEVENT_AFTER_CHANGE_STATUS : fired each time \nafter\n a model changes status\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbefore\n and \nafter\n event type follow the same rules as with \nEvent Sequence\n and in particular you can block a transition by invalidating the \nbefore\n event.\n\n\nIn order to identify exactly what just happened to your model inside the workflow, you must test what are the values of the \nstartStatus\n and \nendStatus\n by calling the\ncorresponding \nWorkflowEvent\n methods.\n\n\n\n\ngetStartStatus() == null \n getEndStatus() != null\n : the model is \nentering\n into the workflow\n\n\ngetStartStatus() =! null \n getEndStatus() != null\n : the model is \nchanging\n status\n\n\ngetStartStatus() == null \n getEndStatus() == null\n : the model is \nleaving\n into the workflow",

To summarize :   eventSequence  : default Id of the event sequence component used by the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  BasicEventSequence  : default event sequence type   If for instance you want to use the  ReducedEventSequence  instead of the default one, you must configure it like you would do for any other Yii2 component.  $config = [\n    // ....\n    'components' =  [\n        // the default event sequence component is configured as a ReducedEventSequence\n        // and not a BasicEventSequence anymore\n        'eventSequence' =  [\n          'class' =  '\\raoul2000\\workflow\\events\\ReducedEventSequence',\n        ]\n   // ...

Two  Generic Events  are always fired by the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  as soon as a model changes status, and this, no matter what  Event Sequence  is configured. In fact\neven if you choose to not use  Event Sequence , the  Generic Events  are fired, because they are fired by the  SimpleWorkflowBehavior  itself, and not by another component (like\nthe event sequence component).  The names of the 2  Generic Events  are :   EVENT_BEFORE_CHANGE_STATUS : fired each time  before  a model changes status  EVENT_AFTER_CHANGE_STATUS : fired each time  after  a model changes status   The  before  and  after  event type follow the same rules as with  Event Sequence  and in particular you can block a transition by invalidating the  before  event.  In order to identify exactly what just happened to your model inside the workflow, you must test what are the values of the  startStatus  and  endStatus  by calling the\ncorresponding  WorkflowEvent  methods.   getStartStatus() == null   getEndStatus() != null  : the model is  entering  into the workflow  getStartStatus() =! null   getEndStatus() != null  : the model is  changing  status  getStartStatus() == null   getEndStatus() == null  : the model is  leaving  into the workflow",

When a model is validated, following occurs :   WorkflowValidator  identifies the pending transition by looking at the  status  attribute value and the current Status  Based on the pending transition, get a  scenario sequence  for each scenario in the scenario sequence, apply corresponding validating rules",

            "text": "Workflow Creation : PHP Source\n\n\nThe way a workflow is defined depends on the \nWorkflow Source\n component we will be using. By default the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n is using an instance of the class \nWorkflowFileSource\n defined in the namespace \nraoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\n. This component is able to read a workflow definition out of an associative PHP array. In this chapter we are going to learn how to create this array and thus define the craziest workflow ever !! ... humm ok, maybe not really....\n\n\nIdentifiers\n\n\nIdentifiers used for both statuses and workflows are case sensitive \nstrings\n that must start with a letter followed by alpha numerical characters. If you need a delimiter, you can use the minus (-) characters.\n\n\nExample :\n\n\n\n\nvalid Ids : 'post', 'draft', 'PostWorkflow', 'My-workflow', 'published'\n\n\ninvalid Ids : 'my workflow', 'draft mode', '01workflow', 'post_workflow'\n\n\n\n\nNote that status Ids are not aimed to be displayed to the user. For this purpose, we'll see below that you can define a \nlabel\n property accessible through the \ngetLabel()\n method implemented by the Status class.\n\n\nStatus Ids : absolute / relative\n\n\nAn \nabsolute status Id\n is a composite value that includes the id of the workflow that owns the status. The characters slash (/) is used to separate both ids. For example, if we have a status with \"draft\" that belong to the workflow 'PostWorkflow', the absolute status Id is 'PostWorkflow/draft'.\n\n\nA \nrelative status id\n is then simply a value that identifies a status out of any workflow. Based on the previous example, the relative status id would be \"draft\".\n\n\nMost of the time you will not have to deal with absolute status id simply because the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n will try to turn it into its absolute form with the help of the current context. Let's see that on an example :\n\n\n$post = new Post();\n$post-\nstatus = 'published';\n$post-\nsave();\necho $post-\nstatus;\n\n\n\n\nThe output is :\n\n\nPostWorkflow/published\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, the absolute status id has been set to \nPostWorkflow/published\n because the default workflow Id for the Post model is \nPostWorkflow\n and this workflow contains a status 'published' (and this 'published' status is also configured as a \ninitial status\n for the workflow \nPostWorkflow\n).\n\n\nActually, the only cases where you would need to use an absolute status id would be :\n\n\n\n\nwhen you want your model to leave a workflow and go into another workflow (inter-workflow transition)\n\n\nconfigure a default status that doesn't belong to the default workflow\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow Provider\n\n\nBy Default the \nWorkflowFileSource\n component reads workflow definition from \nWorkflow provider\n objects. This type of object  implements the \nIWorkflowDefinitionProvider\n interface which defines a single method : \ngetDefinition()\n. This method must return the actual description of our workflow as a PHP array.\n\n\nPostWorkflow.php in @app/models\n\n\nnamespace app\\models;\nclass PostWorkflow implements raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\IWorkflowDefinitionProvider\n{\n    public function getDefinition() {\n        return [\n            // the workflow definition\n        ];\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet's see how this workflow definition array must be structured.\n\n\nThe Workflow\n\n\nThe PHP array defining a workflow is an associative array that must contains 2 keys : \ninitialStatusId\n and \nstatus\n.\n\n\n\n\ninitialStatusId\n : \nstring\n that represents the ID of the initial status\n\n\nstatus\n : \narray\n associative array defining each status that belong to the workflow.\n\n\n\n\n[\n    'initialStatusId' =\n 'draft',\n    'status' =\n [\n        // definition of statuses\n    ]\n]\n\n\n\n\nStatus List Definition\n\n\nThe status list definition is an associative array where keys are status Ids and values are status definitions. If a status doesn't need any particular definition, it can be defined directly as a string value.\n\n\nIn the example below, both \ndraft\n and \npusblised\n have a specific definition, but \narchived\n doesn't.\n\n\n[\n    'initialStatusId' =\n 'draft',\n    'status' =\n [\n        'draft'     =\n [ // single status definition ]\n        'published' =\n [ // single status definition ]\n        'archived'\n    ]\n]\n\n\n\n\nSingle Status Definition\n\n\nA Single Status Definition is an associative array that may contains 2 specific keys : \ntransition\n and \nlabel\n\n\n\n\ntransition\n : \narray|string\n list of ids for all statuses that can be reached\n\n\nlabel\n : \nstring\n user friendly name. If not set, the label is automatically created from the status Id.\n\n\n\n\n[\n    'initialStatusId' =\n 'draft',\n    'status' =\n [\n        'draft'     =\n [\n            'label'      =\n 'Draft State'\n            'transition' =\n // transitions definition\n        ]\n    ]\n]\n\n\n\n\nTransition Definition\n\n\nA Transition Definition is an array or a string defining the list of status that can be reached from the current status. In the example below, we are defining a workflow with following transitions:\n\n\n\n\ndraft -\n published\n\n\npublished -\n draft\n\n\npublished -\n archived\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, there is no transition that leaves the status \narchived\n. Once an item reaches this status it will never move to another status again: \narchived\n is called a \nfinal status\n.\n\n\n[\n    'initialStatusId' =\n 'draft',\n    'status' =\n [\n        'draft'     =\n [\n            'label'      =\n 'Draft State'\n            'transition' =\n 'published'\n        ],\n        'published' =\n [\n            'transition' =\n ['draft','published']\n        ],\n        'archived'\n    ]\n]\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively you can also use a comma separated list of status Id to define a transition. For example, transitions for the \npublished\n status above  could also be written this way :\n\n\n'published' =\n [\n    'transition' =\n 'draft, published'\n]\n\n\n\n\nIn the case you need to configured a transition that targets another workflow, you must use a status id in its  \nabsolute\n form. For example :\n\n\n'published' =\n [\n    'transition' =\n 'draft, anotherWorkflow/toPrint'\n]\n\n\n\n\nMetadata\n\n\nOk, we are now able to create workflows and we can define statuses and transitions between those statuses. As you  can see, the minimum attributes for a status is its \nid\n and optionally we can set a \nlabel\n, but that's all. Well, that's not a lot. What if I need to add more properties to my statuses ? Like for instance it could be nice to associate a color with each status, and display this color to the user (users like colors). The solution is \nmetadata\n.\n\n\nThe \nmetadata\n allows you to add almost any attribute not only to statuses, but also to workflow and transition. Let's see that on an example where we are going to add a \ncolor\n and an \nicon\n metadata to the \npublished\n status.\n\n\n'published' =\n [\n    'metadata' =\n [\n        'color' =\n 'green',\n        'icon'  =\n 'glyphicon glyphicon-pencil'\n    ]\n]\n\n\n\n\nLater on we will be able to retrieve these value of course, and use them the way we want (for instance with a nice and colorful display).\n\n\nExample\n\n\nAs an example we will use our Post workflow designed earlier to manage our publishing platform web app.\n\n\n\n\nBelow is the definition of this workflow ready to be used by the \nSimpleWorkflow\n behavior.\n\n\nnamespace app\\models;\n\nclass PostWorkflow implements raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\IWorkflowDefinitionProvider\n{\n    public function getDefinition() {\n        return [\n            'initialStatusId' =\n 'draft',\n            'status' =\n [\n                'draft' =\n [\n                    'label'      =\n 'Draft Document',\n                    'transition' =\n ['correction']\n                    'metadata'   =\n [\n                        'color' =\n 'yellow'\n                    ]\n                ],\n                'correction' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['draft', 'ready'],\n                    'metadata'   =\n [\n                        'color' =\n 'grey'\n                    ]\n                ],\n                'ready' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['draft', 'correction', 'published'],\n                    'metadata'   =\n [\n                        'color' =\n 'blue'\n                    ]\n                ],\n                'published' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['ready', 'archived'],\n                    'metadata'   =\n [\n                        'color' =\n 'green'\n                    ]                   \n                ],\n                'archived' =\n [\n                    'transition' =\n ['ready'],\n                    'metadata'   =\n [\n                        'color' =\n 'black'\n                    ]                       \n                ]\n            ]\n        ];\n    }\n}",

It is not usually accessed directly but though the \nSimpleWorkflowBehavior\n who loads it by default.\n\n\nTo be able to handle various file formats, the \nWorkflowFileSource\n component relies on a module architecture where the task of \nlocating and loading a file\n is delegated to a class implementing the \nWorkflowDefinitionLoader\n interface. There are currently 3 types of workflow definition loader available with yii2-workflow:\n\n\n\n\nPhpClassLoader\n : loads the workflow definition from a class that implements the \nIWorkflowDefinitionProvider\n interface. This is\nthe default loader\n used by the file source component.\n\n\nPhpArrayLoader\n : loads the workflow definition from a PHP file that must returns a PHP array representing the workflow definition.\n\n\nGraphmlLoader\n : loads the workflow definition from a \nGraphml\n file.\n\n\n\n\nThe two first loader are somewhat equivalent in the way they expect to read workflow definition: they both expected to get a PHP array with the same structure. On the other side, the \nGraphmlLoader\n expects to read an XML file.\n\n\nWorkflow definition as PHP Array\n\n\nBoth \nPhpClassLoader\n (default loader) and \nPhpArrayLoader\n expect to read workflow definition from a PHP array. For a complete description of the expected array format, please refer to the chapter \nDefining a Workflow\n.\n\n\nThis array can be stored as a file or provided by a PHP class.\n\n\nPHP class loader\n\n\nBy default\n, the Workflow source file component uses a \nPhpClassLoader\n that allows you to define your workflow as a PHP class. This class is expected to have the same name as the workflow id, and belong to a namespace.\n\n\nNamespace : workflow location\n\n\nBy default the \nPhpClassLoader\n component loads workflows from the \napp\\models\n namespace. So for example in the following declaration, the default workflow associated with the \nPost\n model will be loaded from the class \napp\\models\\MyWorkflow\n :\n\n\nnamespace app\\models;\nclass Post extends \\yii\\db\\ActiveRecord\n{\n    public function behaviors()\n    {\n        return [\n            [\n                'class' =\n '\\raoul2000\\workflow\\base\\SimpleWorkflowBehavior',\n                'defaultWorkflowId' =\n 'MyWorkflow'\n            ]\n        ];\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nChanging the workflow definition class namespace\n\n\nIf you need to change the default namespace value you have two options : the fast one and the not so fast one.\n\n\nStandard\n\n\nIn general if you need to change any configuration setting, you must explicitly declare it as a Yii2 application component and not rely on \nSimpleworkflowBehavior\n to do it for you. In the example below, we are defining the source component using the default Id (\nworkflowSource\n)\nand set the namespace used by \nPhpClassLoader\n to the location where workflow definitions are supposed to be located (here \n@app/models/workflows\n).\n\n\n$config = [\n    'components' =\n [\n        'workflowSource' =\n [\n          'class' =\n 'raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\WorkflowFileSource',\n          'definitionLoader' =\n [\n              'class' =\n 'raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\PhpClassLoader',\n              'namespace'  =\n '@app/models/workflows'\n           ]\n        ],\n\n\n\n\nAs you may have guessed, \nthere is only one namespace per workflow source\n component so you are encouraged to locate all your workflows in the same namespace. In the case you must load workflows from various location, you should declare another workflow source component (one per namespace) but remember that each workflow source component serves workflows from only one namespace (folder).\n\n\nThe magic alias\n\n\nAs the \nPhpClassLoader\n is the default loader used with the default source component, it is a common task to change the namespace value used to load PHP classes. Consequently having to explicitly declare component just to change one configuration setting is too much work (and we know good developers are lazy). For this purpose the alias \n@workflowDefinitionNamespace\n is available to define globally the namespace value.\n\n\nFor instance, in you \nindex.php\n file, declare this alias :\n\n\nYii::setAlias('@workflowDefinitionNamespace','app\\\\models\\\\workflows');\n\n\n\n\nBy doing so, \nall workflow definition classes\n will be loaded from the \napp\\models\\workflows\n namespace. Note that this alias overrides any specific namespace configuration that you may have defined the \nstandard ways\n.\n\n\nPHP array Loader\n\n\nThe \nPhpArrayLoader\n loads the workflow definitions from a PHP array stored in a file. As it is not the default loader, you must do some configuration to be able to use it. As you don't want to rely on the default behavior, you must explicitly configure the workflow file source component so to use the \nPHPArrayLoader\n class. In the example below, the workflow definition files are assumed to be located in \n@app/models/workflows\n.\n\n\n$config = [\n    'components' =\n [\n        'workflowSource' =\n [\n          'class' =\n 'raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\WorkflowFileSource',\n          'definitionLoader' =\n [\n              'class' =\n 'raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\PhpArrayLoader',\n              'path'  =\n '@app/models/workflows'\n           ]\n        ],\n\n\n\n\nNow if we want to create the definition for the workflow \npost\n, we just create the file \npost.php\n in the folder \n@app/models/workflows\n.\n\n\nreturn [\n    'initialStatusId' =\n 'draft',\n    'status' =\n [\n        'draft' =\n [\n            'transition' =\n ['publish','deleted']\n        ],\n        'publish' =\n [\n            'transition' =\n ['draft','deleted']\n        ],\n        'deleted' =\n [\n            'transition' =\n ['draft']\n        ]\n    ]\n];\n\n\n\n\nWorkflow definition as Graphml file\n\n\nLoading workflow definition from  \ngraphml\n files.\n\n\nFrom the \nThe GraphML File Format\n web site :\n\n\n\n\nGraphML is a comprehensive and easy-to-use file format for graphs. It consists of a language core to describe the structural properties of a graph and a flexible extension mechanism to add application-specific data.\n\n\n\n\nGraphml file can be generated by various graph design applications like \nyEd\n (that I use).\n\n\nBefore being able to load a \nGraphml\n file, you must ensure that following requirements are met :\n\n\n\n\nnodes labels are assigned to status Id and all nodes must have a label (i.e. all status must have an id)\n\n\na custom property called \ninitialStatusId\n must be added to the workflow and assigned with a valid status Id\n\n\n\n\n$config = [\n    'components' =\n [\n        'workflowSource' =\n [\n          'class' =\n 'raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\WorkflowFileSource',\n          'definitionLoader' =\n [\n              'class' =\n 'raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\GraphmlLoader',\n              'path'  =\n '@app/models/workflows'\n           ]\n        ],\n\n\n\n\nUsing yEd\n\n\n\n\nyEd is a powerful desktop application that can be used to quickly and effectively generate high-quality diagrams.\n\n\n\n\nWith this (free) application you can create a workflow and save it as a \ngraphml\n file that can be used as a source for \nSimpleWorkflow\n. This is interesting in particular if you have to deal with big workflows made of more than 10 status, with plenty of transitions that make it\nlook like a plate of spaghetti.\n\n\nThe only tricky thing is that you must define the \ncustom\n property initialStatusId that is required by \nSimpleWorkflow\n. This can be done easily :\n\n\n\n\ncreate a new empty document\n\n\nclick \nEdit \n Manage Custom Properties ...\n\n\nin the \"Graph Properties\" table, click on the \"Add a New property\" button (green plus sign)\n\n\nset \ninitialStatusId\n as name and leave type as default (text)\n\n\nclose the dialog box\n\n\n\n\nYou're ready to go ! Once your workflow is ready to be used with \nSimpleWorkflow\n make sure that you have assigned the correct value to the  \ninitialStatusId\n custom property. To do so, unselect any item and press \nF6\n key (or select \nEdit \n Property...\n from the menu).\nIn the property dialog box, select the \ndata\n panel, and enter the value of the \ninitialStatusId\n in the appropriate text control. Validate with ok.\n\n\n\n\nYour workflow is now ready to be used as a workflow source by \nSimpleWorkflow\n\n\nCache\n\n\nThe \nWorkflowFileSource\n is able to use a cache component to optimize the workflow definition loading task, that can be significant, in particular with workflows containing a lot of status. Another opportunity to use a cache component is if the workflow definition is provided as a Graphml file. In this such a case, if no cache is used, the \nWorkflowFileSource\n component needs to read and parse the \nGraphml\n file quite often (at least once per request).\n\n\nTo configure a cache component you must use the \ndefinitionCache\n parameter. For example :\n\n\n$config = [\n    'components' =\n [\n        'workflowSource' =\n [\n          'class' =\n 'raoul2000\\workflow\\source\\file\\WorkflowFileSource',\n          'definitionCache' =\n [\n                'class' =\n 'yii\\caching\\FileCache',\n          ],\n        ],\n\n\n\n\nThe cache component must implement \nyii\\caching\\Cache\n. To learn more about Yii2 cache feature, please refer to the \nDefinitive Guide to Yii 2.0\n.\n\n\nNote that the cache is not enabled by default.",
